• ChessGPT-Chat: The first two answers started a step-by-step game analysis but were
interrupted and not completed, but the analysis given is reasonable. The third answer
provides a follow-up move for 15...Qxb2, but the user does not provide this step.

• ChessGPT-Base: The first answer is a short review of the Scotch Game, but not a step-by-
step analysis. The second answer mentions other software for game analysis, which is not
what the user asked for. The third answer just repeats the PGN given.

Question: What problems did the Chess GPT Paper solve?
Helpful Answer: The Chess GPT paper addresses several issues in chess, including the difficulty of analyzing chess games, the need for large amounts of annotated data, and the need for a tool for analyzing chess games in a natural language interface. The paper provides an approach that integrates a natural language processing model (GPT-3) with chess-specific data to improve the play of a chess engine. It uses GPT-3 to generate expert moves and analyze the resulting games to identify patterns and improve the engine's play. The paper's contributions include the creation of a large-scale dataset for chess analysis and a neural network model for chess-specific data."

creating systems that can act as guides to humans is demonstrated by Maia [1, 25], in which a model
is trained to predict the next move a human will play, instead of optimizing for winning the game.
In addition to predicting human actions the models have been fine-tuned to predict a given player’s

interest in improving the interpretability [ 32] of these systems and their alignment with human

Question: How does the model mimic human play?
Helpful Answer: The model Maia uses to mimic human play is called a behavioral cloning model. The model uses machine learning algorithms to learn from the data, including the patterns of human behavior in chess games. The model is capable of predicting the next move of a human player at any skill level, even if the model has not seen that player's moves before. This helps to ensure the model is not overfitting to a particular player's behavior and can potentially improve the model's performance."
