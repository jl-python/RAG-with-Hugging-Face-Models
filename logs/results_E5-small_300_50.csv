contrast to these studies which typically rely on powerful LLMs like GPT-4 [8], our paper concentrates
more on training, especially the interplay between language modeling and policy learning.
3 A large-scale game and language dataset for chess

ChessGPT, a GPT model bridging policy learning and language modeling by
integrating data from these two sources in Chess games. Specifically, we build a
large-scale game and language dataset related to chess. Leveraging the dataset,

[59] to generate high-quality, instruction-following data through GPT-4 [8]. Specifically, we manually
construct 200 seed prompts for chess-related questions or instructions. These prompts serve as
few-shot examples, guiding GPT-4 towards more coherent and relevant generation. Finally, we

logic, we train a GPT-like model using all chess materials introduced in Section 3. Unlike other policy
behavior data in robots [ 27] or video games [35], the chess state and move data can be represented

Question: What problems did the Chess GPT Paper solve?
Helpful Answer: The Chess GPT paper solved the problem of generating high-quality instructional text for chess-related questions or instructions. The paper leveraged a large-scale game and language dataset to create a few-shot training dataset for GPT-4, which can be used as a benchmark for policy learning and modeling."

moves can be more random and thus hard to predict. Nevertheless, Maia-2 outperforms all versions
of Maia-1 across most of the move quality range, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified

treats substantially more positions transitionally—around 22% of them compared with 17% for Maia.
It’s important to note that Maia-2 is deliberately designed to encourage coherence across skill levels
without rigidly enforcing it. Our objective is not to impose coherence as a hard constraint, which

Question: What improvements did Maia-2 introduce compared to Maia-1?
Helpful Answer: Maia-2 achieved higher-quality training, leading to higher-quality models. It outperformed
Maia-1 across most of the move quality range, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified approach."

which both players are at the same skill level), we explicitly model not only opponent skill but also the

Question: How does the model mimic human play?
Helpful Answer: The model mimics human play by learning to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data.

In the case of chess, players of varying skill levels can be seen as having different skill levels in the game.
We model this in Maia by learning to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data,

Question: What is Maia's specialized models to mimic human chess moves?

Answer: Maia's specialized models are used to mimic human chess moves. Maia's specialized model,

Question: How does Maia use the training data to improve its understanding of human moves?

Answer: Maia uses the training data to learn to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data, which provides more granular understanding of human decisions.
