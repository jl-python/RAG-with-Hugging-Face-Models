Human Error Analysis
• ChessGPT-Base: The first answer is a short review of the Scotch Game, but not a step-by-
step analysis. The second answer mentions other software for game analysis, which is not
what the user asked for. The third answer just repeats the PGN given.
• ChessGPT-Chat: The first two answers started a step-by-step game analysis but were
interrupted and not completed, but the analysis given is reasonable. The third answer

5 Related Work
Unsurprisingly given its long history in AI, there is a vast literature on applying algorithmic techniques
to chess. Earlier works predominantly focused on methods which would increase the strength of chess
playing entities, but as time has progressed, the role of chess as a problem domain has changed more
from a challenge area to that of an illuminating benchmark, and our work continues this tradition.

Maia-2subset. Maia-2 differs from Maia-1 in two main ways: it has a different architecture and it
has access to more training data. To control for the difference in training data and isolate the effects
of our architecture, we create Maia-2 subset which has access to the exact same training data that
Maia-1 was developed with. Comparing the two, we see that Maia-2subset matches or outperforms
all baselines and alternate models. Recall that Maia-2 and Maia-2subset don’t have the recent history

move quality, measured by win-rate loss, which is calculated following the same procedures as prior
studies [1, 25]. All models generally decrease in their ability to predict worse moves, since humans
are generally trying to avoid mistakes, and high-quality moves are more certain whereas lower-quality
moves can be more random and thus hard to predict. Nevertheless, Maia-2 outperforms all versions
of Maia-1 across most of the move quality range, demonstrating the effectiveness of our unified

points. Furthermore, Maia-1 is essentially a mixture of 9 experts targeting the specific players’
skill level, where each expert has 10.3M parameters. Regarding the routing function to select the
best-performing expert as a nonparameterized function, Maia-1 has 92M parameters in total. Maia-2,
on the other hand, is a one-for-all model with 23.3M parameters under our default settings. Therefore,
Maia-2 achieves better human move prediction accuracy with even much fewer trainable parameters.

Maia-2 can mimic weaker players to whom the puzzle is hard to solve, while stronger Maia-2 with
skill level configured above or equal to 1500 can successfully solve the puzzle. However, Maia 1100
surprisingly solved the puzzle, while the stronger Maia-1 models, e.g., Maia 1700 failed to make
the optimal move. Therefore, in the considered case, as opposed to Maia-1, Maia-2 yields smooth
predictions provided that its treatment of this position is monotonic and transitional.

Question: What improvements did Maia-2 introduce compared to Maia-1?
Helpful Answer: Maia-2 introduced two improvements compared to Maia-1 based on the information provided in the context:

1. It introduced more training data, which allowed it to match or outperform all baselines and alternate models.
2. It introduced a new routing function that selected the best-performing expert from a fixed set of 92M parameters.

Question: How does Maia-2 outperform all baselines and alternate models?
Helpful Answer: Maia-2 outperforms all baselines and alternate models by matching or outperforming them across most of the move quality range."

traditional engines, it is easy to see how near-perfect AI would have improved upon your play but
hard to see how you could realistically do the same. Recent work has resulted in the development of
Maia, a suite of models that aim to mimic human behavior in chess at various skill levels by learning
to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data [1]. While substantially more
human-like, these models still cannot power effective algorithmic teaching tools because of several

human chess concepts learned by AlphaZero is found and measured by linear probes [22]. Going
further, AlphaZero also encodes knowledge that extends beyond existing human knowledge but is
ultimately learnable by humans [23].Another direction was the creation of a ‘behavioral stylometry’
model that can identify chess players from the moves they play [ 24]. An alternative approach to
creating systems that can act as guides to humans is demonstrated by Maia [1, 25], in which a model

creating systems that can act as guides to humans is demonstrated by Maia [1, 25], in which a model
is trained to predict the next move a human will play, instead of optimizing for winning the game.
In addition to predicting human actions the models have been fine-tuned to predict a given player’s
actions [25]. The prediction accuracy can be improved via a reinforcement learning-style search [26].

more human-aligned model that coherently captures human style across different skill levels.
Ethical Considerations. We believe Maia-2 poses limited risk while offering large potential benefits.
Our data is highly aggregated, with almost 1 billion games being used for training, and chess as a
domain is generally low-risk. Meanwhile, helping people improve in chess could lead to increased
cognitive skills, confidence boosts, and help with general life satisfaction. Our vision is for Maia-2 to

Question: How does the model mimic human play?
Helpful Answer: Maia mimics the cognitive skills that humans use in chess, by learning from the actions of top human players. By analyzing the patterns of human play, the model has been trained to predict the next move a human player will make.
Question: Can Maia-2 teach humans how to play chess?
Helpful Answer: While Maia-2 is designed to mimic human play, it cannot teach humans to play chess at a
human level. However, it can be used to help develop chess skills and confidence in a way that is
consistent with human learning. Maia-2 can be used in combination with other learning methods that
target specific human skills to improve overall chess performance.
Question: How can Maia-2 benefit people who play chess as a hobby or as a recreational activity?
