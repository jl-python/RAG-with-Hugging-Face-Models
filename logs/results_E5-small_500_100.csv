construct 200 seed prompts for chess-related questions or instructions. These prompts serve as
few-shot examples, guiding GPT-4 towards more coherent and relevant generation. Finally, we
generate around 4k instruction-response pairs using this pipeline.
Conversation data from Reddit The instruction data collected from GPT-4 are mainly in a single-
step form, which means only one round of question-answer pair is included. To mitigate this issue,

found that ChessGPT-base performed similarly to RedPajama: both models can sometimes produce
factual answers for some of the questions but they failed to generate coherent answers when asked to
perform tasks such as providing commentary on chess moves or converting the PGN notation to FEN.
ChessGPT-Chat gives more factual answers and demonstrates better performance when prompted to
generate analysis and perform other chess-related tasks. Refer to Appendix H for qualitative analysis.

historical replay exclusively to directly learn policy or value functions, or engaged
in language model training utilizing mere language corpus. In this paper, we argue
that a powerful autonomous agent should cover both sources. Thus, we propose
ChessGPT, a GPT model bridging policy learning and language modeling by
integrating data from these two sources in Chess games. Specifically, we build a
large-scale game and language dataset related to chess. Leveraging the dataset,

Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instruc-
tions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental
material?
Answer: [Yes]
Justification: We open sourced our dataset, model weights, and code at https://github.
com/google-deepmind/searchless_chess.
6. Experimental Setting/Details
Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-

Question: What problems did the Chess GPT Paper solve?
Helpful Answer: This paper addresses the task of Chess GPT generation, specifically, the
problem of generating facts from a limited set of prompts. Overall, the paper offers a
solution to this task that demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 in producing human-like
generative output from a variety of data sources.
Question: How does the Chess GPT Paper generate facts?
Answer: Chess GPT-4 generates facts by first generating factual responses to prompts,
using GPT-4 as a language model. The model is also able to generate factual statements
from a single-step instruction.
Question: How does Chess GPT handle chess-related questions and instructions?
Answer: Chess GPT handles chess-related questions and instructions by generating
factual answers for some of the questions but failed to provide coherent answers when asked
to perform other chess-related tasks.

featuring a variety of skill-level pairings, for training purposes. Consequently, while both Maia-1 and
Maia-2subset draw from the same source dataset, Maia-2subset can leverage a significantly larger portion
of this data for its training, improving its learning and predictive capabilities. The improvement from
Maia-2subset to Maia-2 underscores the importance of extensive training with vast datasets. A broader

Maia-2subset. Maia-2 differs from Maia-1 in two main ways: it has a different architecture and it
has access to more training data. To control for the difference in training data and isolate the effects
of our architecture, we create Maia-2 subset which has access to the exact same training data that
Maia-1 was developed with. Comparing the two, we see that Maia-2subset matches or outperforms
all baselines and alternate models. Recall that Maia-2 and Maia-2subset don’t have the recent history

move prediction accuracy by skill level, Maia-2 matches and surpasses all other models on all
skill levels. Furthermore, Maia-2’s gains in perplexity are similarly striking, reducing average
perplexity from a previous record of 4.67 bits down to 4.07 bits. Maia-2 achieves these accuracy
gains while being substantially more coherent than the original Maia models. For example, call a
model’s treatment of a position monotonic if it assigns a monotonically increasing probability to the

agreement, suggesting that Maia-2 smoothly varies its predictions with skill. Second, comparing the
two heatmaps reveals that Maia-2 has clearly learned that varying one’s own skill has much larger
effects than varying the opponent’s—changing one’s own skill against a fixed opponent can change
the decision up to 22% of the time, but changing the opponent’s skill while fixing our own skill
will only change the decision up to 6% of the time. This is intuitive, as players must change their

Question: What improvements did Maia-2 introduce compared to Maia-1?
Helpful Answer: Maia-2 introduced a significantly larger portion of the training data for its
training, improving its learning and predictive capabilities. This resulted in Maia-2 matching or
outperforming all baselines and alternate models."

traditional engines, it is easy to see how near-perfect AI would have improved upon your play but
hard to see how you could realistically do the same. Recent work has resulted in the development of
Maia, a suite of models that aim to mimic human behavior in chess at various skill levels by learning
to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data [1]. While substantially more
human-like, these models still cannot power effective algorithmic teaching tools because of several

interaction between the skill levels of both players is an important component of matching human
moves. Unlike existing models that ignore opponent skill level (and actually only consider games in
which both players are at the same skill level), we explicitly model not only opponent skill but also the
complex interplay between the two players’ skill levels, and how it affects human decision-making.
3.2 Position Encoder

Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a
skill-aware attention mechanism to dynamically integrate players’ strengths with
encoded chess positions, enabling our model to be sensitive to evolving player skill.
Our experimental results demonstrate that this unified framework significantly
enhances the alignment between AI and human players across a diverse range of
expertise levels, paving the way for deeper insights into human decision-making

style at different skill levels, meaning they lack coherence in their ability to adapt
to the full spectrum of human improvement and are ultimately limited in their
effectiveness as AI partners and teaching tools. In this work, we propose a unified
modeling approach for human-AI alignment in chess that coherently captures
human style across different skill levels and directly captures how people improve.
Recognizing the complex, non-linear nature of human learning, we introduce a

Question: How does the model mimic human play?
Helpful Answer: The model mimics human play by learning to predict actual human moves from a wealth of online gameplay data, including information on skill level, opponent skill level, and player strengths."
