# **RAG with Hugging Face Models ðŸ¤—**

**Project Overview**

This project explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a powerful approach that combines document retrieval with language model generation. Instead of relying solely on a language modelâ€™s internal knowledge, RAG retrieves relevant external documents and feeds them into the model to generate more accurate, grounded, and up-to-date responses. The notebook serves as a guided walkthrough for understanding and experimenting with RAG using Hugging Faceâ€™s ecosystem.

**Goals of the Project**

Demonstrate how retrieval can enhance large language models.
Show how to integrate Hugging Face models with vector databases such as FAISS.
Provide examples of retrieving context documents and generating responses that are more factual.
Illustrate step-by-step how to build and evaluate a RAG pipeline.

**Key Components**

- Document Retrieval

    - Uses a retriever (e.g., FAISS) to fetch the most relevant passages from a knowledge base.
    - Language Model Generation
    - Hugging Face Transformers are used to generate responses using both the retrieved context and the userâ€™s query.

- RAG Pipeline

    - Combines the retriever and generator into a single workflow.
    - Allows end-to-end testing of retrieval + generation.

**What Youâ€™ll Learn**

Why RAG is useful for grounding language models in external knowledge.
How to prepare a dataset for retrieval-based tasks.
How Hugging Face libraries support both retrieval and generation.
The strengths and limitations of RAG compared to standard language models.

**Note**

The project is provided as a Jupyter Notebook for educational purposes.
You do not need to run it to understand the concepts â€” the notebook itself is a step-by-step reference guide.
Running it requires installing the dependencies and having a working Python + Jupyter setup, but the explanations inside can be followed without execution.
